        <p>
          This is the second version of a project based on conditional sentences
          in English. Different types of conditional sentences are often
          overlooked in favour of simply teaching the basic 'if' variant.
          However, in spoken English conditionals may go unnoticed in a real
          conversation by those who are not native to the language and are not
          accustomed to the variants.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          They should identify the type of sentence as below and select the
          corresponding option:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>Zero Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>First Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Second Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mixed Conditional</strong>
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          For stronger students, identifying why they have chosen that sentence
          offers them the chance to solidify their knowledge by being able to
          explain the particular elements of all types of conditional sentence.
