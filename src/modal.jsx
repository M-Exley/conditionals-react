          This is the first version of a collection of projects based on
          conditional sentences in English. Different types of conditional
          sentences are often overlooked in favour of simply teaching the 'if'
          variant. However, in spoken English conditionals may go unnoticed in a
          real conversation by those not native to the language who are not
          accustomed to the variants.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In this simple version, conditional sentences are presented in a
          visual way by using purple and orange for the [condition] and
          [result], respectively. It should be used as secondary material once
          all conditional sentences and their variants have been taught as it
          contains a lot of obscure examples.

          The tasks begin automatically but it would be a good idea to use the
          first one as an example to show the students that there is a timer.
          They should identify the type of sentence:
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <strong>Zero Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>First Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Second Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Third Conditional</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mixed Conditional</strong>
        </p>

        <br />
        <p>
          For stronger students, identifying why they have chosen that sentence
          offers them the chance to solidify their knowledge by being able to
          explain the particular elements of all types of conditional sentence.
